## ArcGIS or QGIS basics
### How to calculate the pixel values of multiple raster layers?

1. using the function "spatial analytics -> local -> cell statistics"
2. search for **r.series** in QGIS, calculate accordingly. But notice that this tool cannot be run in normal QGIS, rather in GRASS.
  - input raster layers (choose several);
  - aggregate operation: choose average
3. using "raster calculator", note that you cannot use python syntax there.

### How to permanently remove the background from your MSPA results?

1. Option A: 
- You can convert your raster into polygon at first, as I did in the course.
- Once you got the shape file of your MSPA, you can start editing and delete the redundant polygons (the background) and save the new shape file. 

2. Option B:
- You use the tool **Copy raster**,
- You open the window to copy your raster, there is one parameter named _"NoData Value"_ and set it as ZERO I did here.

3. Option C: also the easiest way 
- Likewise, you export your raster
- Set the NoData value as "0".
That is it, cheers!!

### How to use and show the exported results from MSPA?
- Option 1
1. display it in QGIS
2. use the function: raster layer unique values report, save the table

- Option 2
1. install the "Raster attribute table" plugin. Note: _minimum 3.16.0 version_
2. To obtain the attribute table and explore it in excel.

- Option 3
1. arcmap, import data and check the maps
2. export attribute table and analyze it in excel 
<!-- #```{r iris} -->
<!-- #summary(iris) -->
<!-- #``` -->

<!-- ## Including Plots -->

You can also present your results using, for example, zonal statistics and tabulate area.

### Notes:
1. Vectorize your data in your own personal database in ArcMap to manage your data.
2. Manage your data in ArcMap and QGIS should be aware of the geographic coordidnate system consistency all the time. 
3. Errors in displaying your maps, first have a look at your raster data properties, especially the noData value, GCS and units etc.
