## ArcGIS or QGIS basics
### How to calculate the pixel values of multiple raster layers?

1. using the function "spatial analytics -> local -> cell statistics"
2. search for **r.series** in QGIS, calculate accordingly. But notice that this tool cannot be run in normal QGIS, rather in GRASS.
  - input raster layers (choose several);
  - aggregate operation: choose average
3. using "raster calculator", but note that you cannot use python syntax there.

### How to use and show the exported results from MSPA?
- Option 1
1. display it in QGIS
2. use the function: raster layer unique values report, save the attribute table

- Option 2
1. install the "Raster attribute table" plugin. Note _minimum 3.16.0 version_
2. To obtain the attribute table and explore it in excel.

- Option 3
1. arcmap, import, 
```{r iris}
summary(iris)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
